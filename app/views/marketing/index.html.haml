        %p.lead.m-b-md
          Do you feel like you've landed on the deck of a ship in the middle of a storm? Overwhelmed by all the activity, the last thing you want to do is distract everyone. You'll get around to introducing yourself some other time. Weeks later you decide it's probably too late to bother.
        %h4.m-t-0 What about returning after a long break?
        %p.lead.m-b-md
          Maybe it's worse. You feel like you've climbed aboard a becalmed ghost ship infested with tumble weed. First you worry about what might creep out of the shadows if you make a noise. Then you wonder if it'll ever be worth signing in again. You can see it's been months since anyone posted in the #introductions channel. There doesn't seem much point changing that now.
        %h4.m-t-0 You need a lookout
        %p.lead.m-b-md
          What if someone was always keeping watch over new and returning members. They take time to make them feel at home from the moment they sign in. Your crew work so well together they behave like perfect party hosts through the good times and bad.

        %p.lead.m-b-md.text-muted
          As brilliant as Slack is, it's unreasonable to expect everyone to be online all the time. But if you're not in the office with them and they're not online how will you ever get to know them? You could spend time every day searching through all the chat history. But you've got work to do.
        %p.lead.m-b-md.text-muted
          The greatest minds in your organisation might be capable of the collaboration of the centery. But they don't even know each other exists.
        %p.lead.m-b-md.text-muted
          Imagine if your whole crew was within sight of each other every day. You'd all take pride in the diversity of your organisation. You'd all find more ways to do your best work together.
        %p.lead.m-b-md.text-muted
          But it's almost impossible to get them all online at the same time. How could you get them in the same place every day?

          Every day Cabinbot will curate a deck of profiles showing your whole crew in all their glory. He'll make sure they're shipshape and up-to-date so you'll be proud to inspect them whenever you choose to. Every week Cabinbot will highlight the most interesting profiles so everyone is recognised for their contributions. You and your crew will always feel surrounded esteemed colleagues.
