Will Cabinbot spam all my team members with Direct Messages and/or emails?

No. Cabinbot is completely under your control. He will start by only messaging you, the person who adds him to your Slack team. When you are comfortable for him to, he will slowly introduce himself to other existing members. He'll suggest members that he'd like to contact. But he'll only start conversations with them if someone he's already talking to gives him permission to.

What about new members?

When you are ready you can invite Cabinbot to your primary channel (usually #general). Once you've done that Cabinbot will introduce himself to new members as and when they join. He will also give them a public welcome and encourage others to make them feel at home.

When do I have to pay?

Cabinbot is free for 30 days but limited to interacting with up to 200 team members. If you want to support more than 200 team members or want to use Cabinbot beyond 30 days you will need to upgrade to a paid plan.

What if I can't afford to pay?

Can I have a bot like Cabinbot but with a different name and character?

Maybe.
